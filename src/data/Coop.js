const Coop = `Coop 4 at theScore:

My first term focusing specifically on one side of development. In all my previous work terms, I was a full-stack developer, but this time I was strictly a backend developer. More specifically, I was on the Sports-API team, which controls the core service (as well as a few other microservices) of theScore. I learned a great deal this term, as I got to work with an expansive team of people with varying skillsets. I was very fortunate to be able to pick each of their brains and get a better understanding of what makes them as good as they are.

In the interview for this position, I made sure to stress that even though I was just a co-op, I wanted to be treated and given responsibilities like a full-timer. I thought the team gave me the perfect amount of autonomy to work alone, as well as giving me many opportunities to work with the seniors. My first official ticket this term was to optimize the entirety of the Sports-API service. I made an extensive presentation about optimizing the ruby runtime, and with the feedback of the team, we were able to cut down the latency across the entire service by 10%! Had you told me that I would've been able to do this before the term, I wouldn't have believed you! During the term, much of the attention of the team was focused on the redesign of the Sports-API service to a gateway-based graphql microarchitecture instead of the monolith that it was. I got to see how a new service gets initialized and spun up, as well as create some of the queries that the clients would use. It was awesome to see my work impact the millions of users of theScore!

Some of the technologies I used on the job include Ruby, Ruby On Rails, Elixir, Phoenix, Datadog, k6, JavaScript, Python, AWS, GCP, k8s


Coop 3 at Pexhouse:

Every term seems to be just as fruitful as the last. I learned so much this term about all aspects of software engineering and got to use so many new technologies! This is the one of the main reasons I love working with software so much; there's always something new to learn.

I was given a lot of responsibility this term. The mobile app went from a non-functional piece of frontend software, to a fully-fledged beta released mobile application being tested by hundreds everyday. I built the entirety of the backend using node.js and socket.io and was even able to setup the backend being hosted on an AWS EC2 instance. Had you told me I would've been capable of this two years ago, I would've laughed in your face. Alongside the backend and deployments, I also built several pages of the frontend, and customized the application according to the feedback given to my superiors through the public. Alongside this, I also setup several end-to-end tests for the app to ensure that it remained covered! I feel fortunate to have been given the opportunity to prove myself throughout the course of the term. I was also given small tasks to work on for the website.

Some of the technologies I used on the job include Node, Socket.io, React, React Native, GCP, AWS, Nginx, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, PHP, Android Studio.


Coop 2 at GrantMatch:

I feel like I made a genuine difference at GrantMatch this term. It seemed like every week, my code was pushed for thousands of people to use and see. It was certainly fun!

As with my last term, the beginning was a few onboarding tasks. Simple things like automating background tasks and designing a frontend component. As the term progressed however, the tasks became more and more complex, with each one being of greater importance than the last. For example, by the third week, I was already tasked with designing a whole new dashboard for the GrantMatch platform! It was awesome to see my handiwork being used by all the customers and employees! By the end of the term, I was given some time to study the grant prediction logistic regression model designed by the data engineers, and was told to write my own. At the start of the term, I would never have thought that I would be touching artificial intelligence at all, but I did. I was very fortunate to work with some of the smartest people I've ever met. And to top it all off, I was able to get an outstanding co-op evaluation too! Overall, an incredible term; one that I'm glad went the way it did.

Some of the technologies I used on the job include Python, Django, Docker, Celery, PostgreSQL, JavaScript, Vue, Jest, HTML, CSS, PHP.


Coop 1 at Pexhouse:

I learned a lot this term. For one, I got to work with professional developers and I was able to get a look at production quality code. I was fortunate enough to work with people who were always willing to teach me and answer any questions I might have had.

In the beginning of the term, I was given a few menial changes that were my responsibility. These tasks took no more than half an hour at a time, and essentially served as a means to acclimate me to the source code. I was able to finish all of these tasks, and I was finally given my first 'big' project; the LetsGo Dining mobile app! The app allows groups to randomly find a suitable restaurant based on the preferences of each individual. It was incredible to study the logic, and to implement my own. I was responsible for routing the users to the Yelp page of the selected restaurant, as well as integrating a payment method using the Stripe API. Alongside this project, I was still working on maintaining and developing for the ecommerce website at the same time. This project was my first exposure to API's, and I think I was able to adapt very well. By the end of the term, the app was ready for deployment to the Google Play/App stores, and although my time at the company terminated before the app went live, I was still able to assist in the deployment. The app was built using the Expo platform, and a few modules that were used in the app were depreciated. It was my responsibility to update these modules, and I managed to ready the app for deployment.
