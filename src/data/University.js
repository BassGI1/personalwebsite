It seems like each term is easier than the last in this degree. Yes, there were some annoying courses (looking at you, 307) but overall, the content is becoming more and more interesting and intuitive. It seems like we're finally getting a chance to branch into our own interests within the industry. I can only imagine how enjoyable 4th year will be.

ECE 358 - Computer Networks
8 / 10
I memorized more acronyms in the past 4 months than the 20 years before that. And (almost) all ended with 'P'. HTTP, TCP, SMTP, DHCP, IP, ARP, RIP, OSPF, BGP, DNS, FTP, UDP, ICMP, NAT, MAC, TTL, LAN, WLAN, TLS, MTU... It was fun to learn about the protocols that make the internet work though. Networking is an interesting field for sure.

ECE 351 - Compilers
9.5 / 10
This was a very fun course. Compilers were always intriguing to me ever since I made Huco which was moreso a lexer than a full-fledged compiler. Although the labs were very time-consuming (and written in Java), I found them rewarding. The lab project was to build a compiler for a hardware design language similar to VHDL. We also did some optimization and generated SVGs of the compiled digital circuits. Overall, it was very rewarding! My only complaint is that Java is awful and should never be used for anything besides torture.

ECE 320 - Computer Architecture
9 / 10
If the lectures for this course weren't so strangely scheduled, this would've been my favourite course of the term. For whatever reason, I love really low level stuff like the content of this course. The lab for this course was my favourite lab of any course ever. It was to build a whole processor under the RISC-V instruction set using Verilog. It was very very very time-consuming but I enjoyed all of it.

ECE 307 - Probability Theory and Statistics 2
3 / 10
This course summarized in a story:
ðŸ˜‚the final exam was worth 100%ðŸ˜‚
ðŸ˜‚the final exam was exclusively content that we were explicitly told wouldnt be on the finalðŸ˜‚
ðŸ˜‚the professor comes in midway during the final and asks us about the difficulty of the examðŸ˜‚
ðŸ˜‚the class in unision says 'very hard'ðŸ˜‚
ðŸ˜‚the professor promises not to fail anyoneðŸ˜‚
ðŸ˜‚the final marks seem to be a random() functionðŸ˜‚

SCI 238 - Introductory Astronomy
9 / 10
One of my fondest memories from my childhood is getting a book about the different celestial bodies that we see when we look up. Naturally, I was going to take atleast one astronomy course during my undergrad. This course reignited some of my love for space. I found the format somewhat clunkly, but overall, an enjoyable course.


3A

This was the easiest term of my university career so far. It seemed like the previous courses had allowed me to have an intuition for this term's courses. I finally got to pick an elective! I chose Psych 207.

ECE 380 - Analog Control Systems
8 / 10
I felt like this course had little content in it, so it felt somewhat simple. That being said, the content was very interesting. It was incredible to watch the mathematics we had been learning for several courses being expressed physically in some controllers.

ECE 350 - Real Time Operating Systems
8 / 10
Was a very interesting course detailing the implementations of several concepts that we had learned in previous courses (i.e. implementation of mutexes and semaphores). The lab for this course was to build a fully functioning operating system on an STM32 Nucleoboard. Surprisingly, I found much of this course intuitive.

ECE 327 - Digital Hardware Systems
9 / 10
This was my favourite course of the term. I genuinely enjoy writing Verilog code. This course seemed like a gateway into some of the core courses of computer engineering. This is something I would love to work in in the future.

ECE 318 - Communication Systems
4 / 10
This course made me hate the Sine and Cosine functions. There was just too much math in this course, and I found myself memorizing problems instead of understanding them. The content was just too fast-paced for me to build any sort of intuition for anything in the course. Moreover, the content in this course wasn't particularly interesting for me, so I struggled with this course. The professor was excellent though.

Psych 207 - Cognitive Processes
8 / 10
This was my first elective! I wanted to get one of natural science requirements out of the way early so I took this course. This turned out to be a very interesting course!


2B

This term can be summed up in one word: Labs. So much time spent in the labs. So much debugging. It's stuff like this that makes me wish I'd gone into computer science instead. To be honest, although the labs were extremely intense, they were probably my favourite part of the term. The labs this term were different than previous labs in that they were (a lot longer) more practical; I could see how I would use this information as a professional engineer. This term was also the return of 8:30 AM lectures (great). All in all, probably the best academic term I've had in my degree thus far.

ECE 298 - Instrumentation and Prototyping Lab
7 / 10
The professor was so experienced in engineering, he helped us with labs in other courses. Besides that, this course was fun. Just a simple quarter credit course that only took ~30 hours per lab. Of which there were 5. Nothing too rough. Simple. Very simple. Child's play.

ECE 252 - Systems Programming and Concurrency
8 / 10
This would have been my favourite course of my undergrad had the labs been more organized. The content was so interesting; learning low-level OS interactions was some of the most fun I've had in my undergrad this far. Unfortunately, the labs being so disorganized and marking being so inconsistent really put a dark spot on this course for me. All in all, however, still an excellent course. The professor was awesome too.

ECE 224 - Embedded Microprocessor Systems
8 / 10
This was a fun course. It was very interesting to learn about the architecture of computers. The labs were very fun, and I felt like I was actually building something useful. The final project was to build a music player using C. I had a lot of fun with this course.

ECE 208 - Discrete Math and Logic 1
2 / 10
*sigh* Discrete math is back again, and this time, it's even more non-sensical than the last time! Sure there were some interesting concepts (satisfiability, DPLL, wffs and formula trees) but there was one BIG topic that plagued the course at every turn: proofs. I have genuinely never despised an academic topic as much as I have Hilbert and First Order Logic proofs. This topic single-handedly drops the course from a 0.9 to a 0.25. Completely useless topic that will never be used by anyone, and was needlessly complicated. The instructors were awesome though.

ECE 207 - Signals and Systems
7 / 10
This was just basically discrete calculus. It was very interesting to learn about working with electrical signalling and sampling. Not personally my biggest interest but I can see the content being relevant to an engineer, so I understand why it's a core course.

ECE 203 - Probability Theory and Statistics 1
8 / 10
Just a really math-heavy course. The professor really knew his stuff and he really seemed to care about the level of education he gave us. I have no real complaints at all about the course. Interesting content. Fair examinations. Excellent instructors. It was really interesting to dive into the mathematics behind randomness, and I can see that probability and stats is a very deep branch of mathematics.


2A

The most enjoyable term of my university experience so far (probably because there was no physics courses). It seems as though we're starting to specialize in computers instead of building up the required knowledge in order to understand the higher material. This term has given me a deeper understanding of how computers are designed, and the algorithms that make them as efficient as they are. If this term has done anything for me, it has stimulated my interest in my degree even more!

ECE 250 - Algorithms and Data Structures
8 / 10
A lot of the content in this course was somewhat intuitive but could get complicated at times. I thoroughly enjoyed the projects and I have a much deeper understanding of why optimization is such an important thing in software development. Overall, an excellent course.

ECE 240 - Electronic Circuits 1
7 / 10
I expected this course to build off ECE 140 - Linear Circuits, and it certainly did. By the end of the course, 140 seemed like child's play. However, the course was surprisingly fun and was very well taught and marked.

ECE 222 - Digital Computers
9 / 10
My favourite course in my undergrad before this term was ECE 124 - Digital Circuits and Systems. I expected this course to be much of the same, but I was surprised to see how little the content in that course was needed for this one. That being said, this was still my favourite course of the term. Doing the labs in this course made me feel like a legitimate engineer, and learning about hardware architecture opened a whole new topic that I never knew I would be so invested in.

ECE 205 - Advanced Calculus 1
10 / 10
I think this term made me realize how much I enjoy pure mathematics. The knowledge gained from this course seems extremely applicable to everything I want to pursue in my career, as well as being very fun! The only issue I had with this course is that it was one of the last pure math courses I'll take in my undergrad.

ECE 204 - Numerical Methods
5 / 10
The content was extremely interesting, but I was not a fan of the way in which the course was taught. The algorithms I studied in this course were fascinating and gave me an entirely new view on optimization and the applications of approximations in computing. Would have been one of my favourite course of my undergrad had it been taught in a more rigid manner.

ECE 109 - Materials Chemistry for Engineers
8 / 10
A chemistry course. The professor did an excellent job in teaching and I thought that the marking was extremely fair. Chemistry was never my favourite subject, but this course was both fun and challenging.


1B

This was my first in-person university term. I did not expect the workload to increase this much just because the term was in-person. Besides the increased workload, I found that the in-person lectures allowed me to absorb the information presented better. Moreover, all of my professors this term were excellent at presenting the content in an engaging manner and I found myself actually enjoying lectures (unbelievable!). All in all, I honestly prefer in-person classes.

ECE 192 - Engineering Economics and Impact on Society
8 / 10
A very basic economics course. Most of it was simple algebra, so it was not as stressful as the other five courses. It was honestly a breath of fresh air from all of the barely comprehensible math and circuits courses.

ECE 140 - Linear Circuits
7 / 10
A very challenging course, but the time spent studying for this course was always fruitful. The material also seems extremely useful and I expect most of my future courses to conatin at least some of the content covered in this course. Overall, a good course.

ECE 124 - Digital Circuits and Systems
10 / 10
Ok, THIS is the most fun course I've taken so far in my undergrad. This course served as the basis for all of computer hardware engineering, and the material was very very interesting. We started off learning basic logic gates and their functions, and by the end we were designing complicated systems (like an HVAC) using these same principles. There were some dry parts of the course, but the majority of the content was incredibly captivating. The instructors were awesome too, and they seemed to enjoy teaching the content as much as I enjoyed learning it. 10/10 course, I'm very excited for the subsequent courses!

Math 119 - Calculus 2
9 / 10
Honestly a super fun course; much better than Calculus 1 (which was fairly dry at some points). Taylor series, approximations, optimization, multivariable calculus . . . all of these topics are central to engineering as a whole. I definitely expect this course to be one of the more important ones of all of my undergrad. Moreover, my professor for this course was genuinely the best professor I could've imagined. Awesome course.

ECE 108 - Discrete Math and Logic 1
6 / 10
Fake math. Where were all the numbers? In all seriousness, this course was very dry (I HATE PROOFS) to me. I can't really see where most of the concepts covered in this course can be applied. There were some fun parts and the professor was awesome though.

ECE 106 - Electricity and Magnetism
2 / 10
This just in, physics courses are still very hard. This was ECE 105 all over again. I felt as though I had a good conceptual grasp of all the problems, but actually applying them seemed like sorcery to me. I'm very glad that this is the last physics course of my degree, because I've come to the conclusion that I'm terrible at physics. Professor Saini was great though.


1A

I learned a lot this term. For one, university difficulty >>> high school. Other than that, I learned that marks are no longer as important as they were in high school, which doesn't mean I shouldn't put any effort in, but it means that I don't have to stress myself out over every percentage.

ECE 198 - Project Studio
8 / 10
This was a project course, in which we had to program a game or something of the sort on the STM32 NucleoBoard using the C programming language. Fun course.

ARTS 190 - First-Year Topics in Arts
7 / 10
This one was about picking a problem and providing a technical solution. I chose cryptocurrency and its instability.

ECE 190 - Engineering Profession and Practice
9 / 10
To be completely honest, I didn't really learn much from this course. There were a few fun group projects, but there was nothing that I came out knowing that I didn't already know before. Was a good time.

ECE 150 - Fundamentals of Programming
10 / 10
What a beautiful course. I'd never had as much fun learning as I had in this course this far. The concepts were super interesting to me as someone who is very interested in software development (probably why I loved this course as much as I did). The instructors were clearly very passionate about software, and were always willing to help. The TAs were awesome too. All examinations were fair. 10/10 course.

Math 117 - Calculus 1
9 / 10
Honestly a really fun course. It made me feel very smart (until the final) because the concepts were just the right amount of challenging where you felt accomplished if you got a question right. And then the final came. The class average on the final was about a 55.

Math 115 - Linear Algebra 1
5 / 10
This one was quite difficult. Everything taught in this course is very abstract, and while I don't see the practical applications of it now, I'm sure I'll have a few epiphanies in the future.

ECE 105 - Classical Mechanics
2 / 10
What. Why. For what purpose did I have to take this class. This was easily the worst academic experience I've ever had the displeasure of undergoing. What relevance does CLASSICAL MECHANICS have to a COMPUTER ENGINEER??? And why was this course so difficult?? The professors were nice, but they were too smart for me (and the class too apparently). They were always willing to help, but it was clear that they couldn't bring themselves down to our level in order to  properly explain the concepts to us. Moreover, the quizzing software was unbelievably buggy, and sometimes the answers on assignments were blatantly incorrect. As far as I'm aware, this course is more or less a 'rite of passage' from the ECE faculty.`
