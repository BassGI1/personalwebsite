            experience: "What a beautiful course. I'd never had as much fun learning as I had in this course thus far. The concepts were super interesting to me as someone who is very interested in software development (probably why I loved this course as much as I did). The instructors were clearly very passionate about software, and were always willing to help. The TAs were awesome too. All examinations were fair. 10/10 course."

It made me feel very smart (until the final) because the concepts were just the right amount of challenging where you felt accomplished if you got a question right. And then the final came. I already had a 61 before the final and I see why they made the pre-final course so easy. The class average on the final was like a 55."

I suck at linear algebra. I still comfortably passed, but wow do I suck at this. Moreover, I can't really see the application of the majority of the concepts covered in this course. Matrices and imaginary numbers I can understand, but I don't see how bases and subspaces are useful. Maybe I'll have a few epiphanies when I get older."

            experience: "What. Why. For what purpose did I have to take this class. This was easily the worst academic experience I've ever had the displeasure of undergoing. What relevance does CLASSICAL MECHANICS have to a COMPUTER ENGINEER??? Why was this course so difficult?? I literally couldn't care less about rotational kinematics as someone who wants to build computers. So why do I or anybody in ELECTRICAL, COMPUTER, and SOFTWARE ENGINEERING have to learn about classical mechanics. The professors were nice, but they were too smart for me (and the class too apparently). They were always willing to help, but it was clear that they couldn't bring themselves down to our level in order to properly explain the concepts to us. Moreover, the quizzing software was unbelievably buggy, and sometimes the answers on assignments were blatantly incorrect. I practically stopped trying in this class after midterms because of how poorly run this class was. I finished with a 62, and I'm proud that managed to make it through this hell-hole."
