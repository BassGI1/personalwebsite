What relevance does CLASSICAL MECHANICS have to a COMPUTER ENGINEER??? And why was this course so difficult?? The professors were nice, but they were too smart for me (and the class too apparently). They were always willing to help, but it was clear that they couldn't bring themselves down to our level in order to  properly explain the concepts to us. Moreover, the quizzing software was unbelievably buggy, and sometimes the answers on assignments were blatantly incorrect.

The app allows groups to randomly find a suitable restaurant based on the preferences of each individual. It was incredible to study the logic, and to implement my own. I was responsible for routing the users to the Yelp page of the selected restaurant, as well as integrating a payment method using the Stripe API. Alongside this project, I was still working on maintaining and developing for the ecommerce website at the same time. This project was my first exposure to API's, and I think I was able to adapt very well. By the end of the term, the app was ready for deployment to the Google Play/App stores, and although my time at the company terminated before the app went live, I was still able to assist in the deployment. The app was built using the Expo platform, and a few modules that were used in the app were depreciated. It was my responsibility to update these modules, and I managed to ready the app for deployment.",
