The concepts were super interesting to me as someone who is very interested in software development (probably why I loved this course as much as I did). The instructors were clearly very passionate about software, and were always willing to help. The TAs were awesome too. All examinations were fair. 10/10 course."

What relevance does CLASSICAL MECHANICS have to a COMPUTER ENGINEER??? And why was this course so difficult?? The professors were nice, but they were too smart for me (and the class too apparently). They were always willing to help, but it was clear that they couldn't bring themselves down to our level in order to properly explain the concepts to us. Moreover, the quizzing software was unbelievably buggy, and sometimes the answers on assignments were blatantly incorrect. As far as I'm aware, this course is more or less a 'rite of passage' from the ECE faculty."
