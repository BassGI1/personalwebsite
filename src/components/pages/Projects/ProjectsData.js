For the databases, an AWS S3 bucket is used for image storage, and the user storage is done with mongoDB. Users are able to make posts, comment on their friends posts, direct message their friends/followers, as well as several other key features of a social media. The aspect that distinguishes harmonise from other social media apps is that it doubles as a music sharing app! Users are able to set a 'theme' song that plays when their profile is visited! You can sign up for free!",
